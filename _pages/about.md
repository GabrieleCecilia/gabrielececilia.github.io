I am a PhD student at the School of Computer and Cyber Sciences at Augusta University. My advisor is [Dr. Cl√©ment Aubert](https://spots.augusta.edu/caubert/). I am working on the [Concurrency in Reversible Computations](https://github.com/CinRC) project.

My research interests include (reversible) concurrent calculi and interactive theorem proving, within the broader field of Formal Methods.
